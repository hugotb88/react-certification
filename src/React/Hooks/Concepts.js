    =================== Basics =================== 
/*
    Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.
    Hooks allow FUNCTION COMPONENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO STATE AND OTHER REACT FEATURES. 
    Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

    But Class Components are still available in React.

    Hook definition
    Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.
*/

    ================= Hook Rules ================= 
/*
    There are 3 rules for hooks:

    Hooks can only be called INSIDE REACT FUNCTION COMPONENTS.
    Hooks can only be CALLED AT THE TOP LEVEL of a component.
    Hooks CANNOT BE CONDITIONAL
    
    ** Note: Hooks will not work in React class components.
*/

    ================= Custom Hooks ================= 
// You can create your own Hooks if you need specific behaviour.


    =========== Hooks that already exist ===========
/*
    - useState      --> To track the state in a Function Component (Data or properties that need to be tracking)
    - useEffect
    - useContext
    - useRef
    - useReducer
    - useCallback
    - useMemo
